# Release Notes Template

This document provides a template and guidelines for writing consistent release notes for the `dockerutilities` project, with integration for GoReleaser automated changelog generation.

## GoReleaser Integration

### Overview
This project uses GoReleaser for automated release management, which includes:
- **Automated Changelog Generation**: Creates changelogs from git commit messages
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Builds binaries for 6 platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows amd64/arm64)
- **GitHub Release Creation**: Automatically creates GitHub releases with artifacts
- **Version Injection**: Embeds version information from git tags

### Hybrid Approach: GoReleaser + Manual Enhancement
We use a hybrid approach that combines:
1. **GoReleaser Automated Changelog**: Auto-generated from commit messages
2. **Manual Enhancement**: User-focused content added manually for clarity and context

### GoReleaser Changelog Configuration
The project's `.goreleaser.yml` includes changelog configuration:
```yaml
changelog:
  sort: asc
  filters:
    exclude:
      - '^docs:'
      - '^test:'
      - '^ci:'
      - Merge pull request
      - Merge branch
```

This configuration:
- Sorts commits chronologically (ascending)
- Excludes documentation, test, and CI commits
- Excludes merge commits for cleaner changelogs

## Writing Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **User-Focused**: Write from the user's perspective
2. **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
3. **Consistent Format**: Follow the template structure
4. **Actionable**: Tell users what they need to know or do
5. **GoReleaser Integration**: Leverage automated changelog while adding user context

### Section Guidelines

#### üéâ What's New
- Focus on user-visible features and improvements
- Explain the benefit to users
- Use present tense
- Be specific about what changed
- **For Development Releases**: Include testing context and usage notes

**Good Examples:**
- Added Docker image layer analysis with detailed file listings
- Implemented web interface for interactive image exploration
- Added support for multi-platform Docker image builds
- **Development**: Added Docker Compose analysis (alpha feature - test with simple compose files)

**Avoid:**
- "Fixed various bugs" (too vague)
- "Improved performance" (not specific enough)

#### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Describe the problem that was fixed
- Mention the impact on users
- Include issue numbers if applicable
- **For Development Releases**: Include verification steps

**Good Examples:**
- Fixed crash when analyzing images with empty layers
- Resolved memory leak in large image processing
- Fixed incorrect file permissions in extracted layers
- **Development**: Fixed circular dependency detection (verify with complex compose files)

#### üîß Improvements
- Describe enhancements to existing features
- Focus on user benefits
- Be specific about improvements
- **For Development Releases**: Include testing context

**Good Examples:**
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Enhanced performance for large image analysis
- Added progress indicators for long-running operations
- **Development**: Enhanced compose file parsing (test with various formats)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Clearly explain what changed
- Provide migration steps if needed
- Use warning emoji to draw attention
- Explain why the change was necessary
- **For Development Releases**: Emphasize this is expected in alpha/beta releases

**Good Examples:**
- Changed default port from 8080 to 9090 (use `--port` flag to override)
- Renamed `--image` flag to `--target` for clarity
- Removed deprecated `--legacy` option
- **Development**: Changed compose analysis API (breaking change expected in alpha)

#### üì¶ Dependencies
- List significant dependency updates
- Mention security updates
- Note any compatibility changes
- **For Development Releases**: Note any experimental dependencies

#### üìù Testing Notes (Development Releases Only)
- Provide specific testing instructions
- List expected behavior and limitations
- Include how to report issues
- Mention any special setup requirements

**Good Examples:**
- Test with various Docker Compose file formats (v1, v2, v3)
- Verify environment variable resolution works correctly
- Check performance with large compose projects (>50 services)
- Report issues with sample compose files attached

### Version Numbering

#### Semantic Versioning
- **Major.Minor.Patch** (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.2.3)
- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

#### Development Versions
- **Alpha**: Early development, major features incomplete
  - Format: `v1.0.0-alpha.1`, `v1.0.0-alpha.2`
  - Use for testing incomplete features
- **Beta**: Feature complete, testing phase
  - Format: `v1.0.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-beta.2`
  - Use for final testing before release
