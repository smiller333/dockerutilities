## Writing Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **User-Focused**: Write from the user's perspective
2. **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
3. **Consistent Format**: Follow the template structure
4. **Actionable**: Tell users what they need to know or do

### Section Guidelines

#### üéâ What's New
- Focus on user-visible features and improvements
- Explain the benefit to users
- Use present tense
- Be specific about what changed

**Good Examples:**
- Added Docker image layer analysis with detailed file listings
- Implemented web interface for interactive image exploration
- Added support for multi-platform Docker image builds

**Avoid:**
- "Fixed various bugs" (too vague)
- "Improved performance" (not specific enough)

#### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Describe the problem that was fixed
- Mention the impact on users
- Include issue numbers if applicable

**Good Examples:**
- Fixed crash when analyzing images with empty layers
- Resolved memory leak in large image processing
- Fixed incorrect file permissions in extracted layers

#### üîß Improvements
- Describe enhancements to existing features
- Focus on user benefits
- Be specific about improvements

**Good Examples:**
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Enhanced performance for large image analysis
- Added progress indicators for long-running operations

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Clearly explain what changed
- Provide migration steps if needed
- Use warning emoji to draw attention
- Explain why the change was necessary

**Good Examples:**
- Changed default port from 8080 to 9090 (use `--port` flag to override)
- Renamed `--image` flag to `--target` for clarity
- Removed deprecated `--legacy` option

#### üì¶ Dependencies
- List significant dependency updates
- Mention security updates
- Note any compatibility changes

### Version Numbering

#### Semantic Versioning
- **Major.Minor.Patch** (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.2.3)
- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

#### Development Versions
- **Alpha**: Early development, major features incomplete
  - Format: `v1.0.0-alpha.1`, `v1.0.0-alpha.2`
- **Beta**: Feature complete, testing phase
  - Format: `v1.0.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-beta.2`
