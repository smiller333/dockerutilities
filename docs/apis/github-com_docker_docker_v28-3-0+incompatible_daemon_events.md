## Types

### Events

Events is pubsub channel for events generated by the engine.

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L18)  

```go
type Events struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

#### Functions

##### New

New returns new *Events instance

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L25)  

```go
func New() *Events
```

#### Methods

##### Events.Evict

Evict evicts listener from pubsub

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L77)  

```go
func (e *Events) Evict(l chan interface{})
```

##### Events.Log

Log creates a local scope message and publishes it

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L83)  

```go
func (e *Events) Log(action eventtypes.Action, eventType eventtypes.Type, actor eventtypes.Actor)
```

##### Events.PublishMessage

PublishMessage broadcasts event to listeners. Each listener has 100 milliseconds to
receive the event or it will be skipped.

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L112)  

```go
func (e *Events) PublishMessage(jm eventtypes.Message)
```

##### Events.Subscribe

Subscribe adds new listener to events, returns slice of 256 stored
last events, a channel in which you can expect new events (in form
of interface{}, so you need type assertion), and a function to call
to stop the stream of events.

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L36)  

```go
func (e *Events) Subscribe() ([]eventtypes.Message, chan interface{}, func())
```

##### Events.SubscribeTopic

SubscribeTopic adds new listener to events, returns slice of 256 stored
last events, a channel in which you can expect new events (in form
of interface{}, so you need type assertion).

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L53)  
**Added in:** v1.10.0

```go
func (e *Events) SubscribeTopic(since, until time.Time, ef *Filter) ([]eventtypes.Message, chan interface{})
```

##### Events.SubscribersCount

SubscribersCount returns number of event listeners

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/events.go#L128)  

```go
func (e *Events) SubscribersCount() int
```

### Filter

Filter can filter out docker events from a stream

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/filter.go#L10)  
**Added in:** v1.9.0

```go
type Filter struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

#### Functions

##### NewFilter

NewFilter creates a new Filter

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/filter.go#L15)  
**Added in:** v1.9.0

```go
func NewFilter(filter filters.Args) *Filter
```

#### Methods

##### Filter.Include

Include returns true when the event ev is included by the filters

**Source:** [View Source](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/v28.3.0/daemon/events/filter.go#L20)  
**Added in:** v1.9.0

```go
func (ef *Filter) Include(ev events.Message) bool
```
