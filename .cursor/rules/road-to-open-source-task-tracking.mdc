# Road to Open Source Task Tracking Rule

## Purpose

This rule ensures that when working on files in the `docs/road_to_open_source/` directory, any tasks completed during the current chat session are immediately and properly marked as completed in the relevant documentation files.

## Task Completion Requirements

### Immediate Task Marking
When a task is completed in the current chat session:

1. **Update the specific guide file** where the task is documented
2. **Mark with appropriate completion indicator** using standardized format
3. **Update overview files** (README.md) to reflect progress
4. **Add completion timestamp** where beneficial

### Standardized Completion Indicators

#### For Major Sections/Phases
- `✅ COMPLETED` - Full section completion
- `✅ DOCUMENTATION COMPLETED` - Documentation phase done
- `✅ SECURITY COMPLETED` - Security implementation done
- `🚧 IN PROGRESS` - Currently being worked on
- `⚠️ PARTIAL` - Partially implemented

#### For Individual Tasks
- `✅ Fixed` - Bug fixes and security issues resolved
- `✅ Enhanced` - Improvements and enhancements completed
- `✅ Added` - New features or documentation created
- `✅ Updated` - Modifications to existing items completed
- `✅ Renamed` - Renaming/refactoring completed
- `✅ Implemented` - Feature implementation completed
- `- [x]` or `- ✅` - Checklist items completed

#### For Pending Tasks
- `🚫 Required` - Still needs implementation
- `🚫 Recommended` - Optional but beneficial
- `- [ ]` - Uncompleted checklist items

### Priority Levels (maintain consistency)
- 🔴 CRITICAL
- 🟡 HIGH
- 🔵 MEDIUM  
- 🟢 LOW

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Identify Completed Work
When any implementation work is completed in the current session, immediately identify which documented tasks have been fulfilled.

### Step 2: Update Specific Guide Files
Update the relevant guide file(s) in `docs/road_to_open_source/` with completion markers:

```markdown
Completed tasks:
- ✅ Replace tar command execution with Go native library (Completed: 2025-01-21)
- ✅ Improve path validation for build context
- ✅ Add security warnings for untrusted images
```

### Step 3: Update Overview Documentation
Update `docs/road_to_open_source/README.md` to reflect progress:

```markdown
### Phase 1: Critical Security & Foundation (1-2 days) ✅ **COMPLETED**
```markdown
Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL - ✅ COMPLETED
Completed: SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

Completed tasks:
- ✅ Replace tar command execution with Go native library
- ✅ Improve path validation for build context  
- ✅ Add security warnings for untrusted images
```

### Step 4: Update Status Tables
When status tables exist, update them accordingly:

| Area | Guide | Status | Priority |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Security** | Security Implementation | ✅ Complete | 🔴 Critical |
| **CLI** | CLI Improvement | ✅ Complete | 🟡 High |

## File-Specific Requirements

### README.md Updates
- Update implementation status table
- Mark completed phases with ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Update success criteria checkboxes
- Update progress percentages if present

### Individual Guide File Updates  
- Mark specific tasks as completed with appropriate indicators
- Update progress tracking sections
- Add completion context when helpful
- Maintain chronological order of completions

### Cross-File Consistency
Ensure that:
- Overview progress matches individual guide progress
- Status indicators are consistent across files
- Completion timestamps are accurate
- All related documentation reflects the same state

## Quality Assurance

### Before Completing Session
1. **Verify all completed work is documented** with proper completion markers
2. **Check cross-file consistency** between overview and detailed guides
3. **Ensure completion dates** match implementation timeline
4. **Update any summary sections** that reference the completed work

### Validation Rules
- **Never mark tasks complete** unless actually implemented in current session
- **Always provide context** for complex completions
- **Maintain traceability** between task completion and actual changes
- **Update dependent tasks** when prerequisites are completed

## Examples

### Security Task Completion
When security improvements are implemented:

```markdown
### 🟡 MEDIUM-003: Replace Command Injection in Tar Extraction ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Status:** ✅ Fixed with Go native archive/tar library (Completed: 2025-01-21)
**Implementation:** Replaced exec.Command("tar") with secure Go native implementation
```

### CLI Improvement Completion
When CLI commands are improved:

```markdown
### Issue 1: Command Naming Convention ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Solution Implemented:** ✅ Renamed `tools` command to `server` (Completed: 2025-01-21)
**Files Updated:** cmd/tools.go renamed to cmd/server.go, documentation updated
```

### Documentation Task Completion
When documentation is created or updated:

```markdown
Completed documentation tasks:
- ✅ Enhanced README.md with modern design and comprehensive examples
- ✅ Created comprehensive API documentation (../API.md)  
- ✅ Added detailed user guide with tutorials (../USER_GUIDE.md)
- ✅ Created complete CLI reference (../CLI_REFERENCE.md)
```

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Marking tasks complete before actual implementation
- Inconsistent status indicators across files
- Missing updates to overview documentation
- Incorrect completion timestamps
- Forgetting to update related status tables

### Best Practices
- Complete documentation updates immediately after implementation
- Use consistent language and indicators
- Provide sufficient context for future reference
- Cross-reference related tasks when updating status
- Maintain chronological accuracy in completion tracking

This rule ensures accurate progress tracking and maintains the integrity of the road_to_open_source documentation system.
